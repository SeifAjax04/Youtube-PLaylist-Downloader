## Overview

Python provides several choices for creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). Among these methods, Tkinter stands out as the most widely adopted. Tkinter serves as the default Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit that comes bundled with Python. Leveraging Python with Tkinter proves to be the swiftest and most straightforward approach for crafting GUI applications.
In this guide, we will explore the process of developing a GUI application in Python for downloading either a single YouTube video or an entire YouTube playlist.
Before diving into the implementation, let's first delve into the pyyoutube module. The pyyoutube module offers a user-friendly means of interacting with the YouTube Data API V3.

## Installation

Install the required packages using the following commands:

```bash
pip install python-youtube
pip install pytube
pip install tk
