## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Tkinter:** The standard GUI package for Python.
- **pyyoutube:** Provides an easy way to use the YouTube Data API V3.
- **pytube:** A lightweight library for downloading YouTube videos.
- **Threading in Tkinter:** Used for managing multiple tasks concurrently within the Tkinter GUI.

## Overview

Python provides several choices for creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). Among these methods, Tkinter stands out as the most widely adopted. Tkinter serves as the default Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit that comes bundled with Python. Leveraging Python with Tkinter proves to be the swiftest and most straightforward approach for crafting GUI applications.
In this guide, we will explore the process of developing a GUI application in Python for downloading either a single YouTube video or an entire YouTube playlist.
Before diving into the implementation, let's first delve into the pyyoutube module. The pyyoutube module offers a user-friendly means of interacting with the YouTube Data API V3.

## Features

- get_list_videos:- It will give a list of all video links of a YouTube playlist.
- threading:- It is used for threading in Tkinter.
- download_videos:- It is used for downloading YouTube video.
